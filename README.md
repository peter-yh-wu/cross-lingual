# Cross-lingual Transfer for Speech Processing using Acoustic Language Similarity

Indic TTS Samples can be found at [https://peter-yh-wu.github.io/cross-lingual/](https://peter-yh-wu.github.io/cross-lingual/)

Code for neural ASR & TTS experiments can be found at [https://github.com/peter-yh-wu/espnet](https://github.com/peter-yh-wu/espnet)

 - The [javanese_asr](https://github.com/peter-yh-wu/espnet/tree/javanese_asr) branch contains scripts to train the Javanese ASR model in `egs2/java`
 - The [sundanese_asr](https://github.com/peter-yh-wu/espnet/tree/sundanese_asr) branch contains scripts to train the Sundanese ASR model in `egs2/sunda`
 - The [indic_tts](https://github.com/peter-yh-wu/espnet/tree/indic_tts) branch contains scripts to train the Indic TTS models in `egs/cmu_indic`

Further instructions for running experiments will be added soon!
